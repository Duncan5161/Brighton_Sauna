# Flask application - Brighton Sauna Selector
This is a simple application to help anyone living in or visitng Brighton to decide which of the three saunas are best for them to use. The application hosts a ten question quiz, of which the user may answer any number they wish, and then renders a result to suggest which would be their prefered sauna(s). On the result page, it contains links to the chosen sauna(s) and scrapes the current temperature in Brighton and displays it. The user may be told that two or even all three saunas are tied.
